# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "Hello! My name is Sameeksha Nair and I am a recent graduate from the University of Windsor where I did my Bachelor in Computer Science (Honours) with a 
specialization in Game Development. I am ambitious, passionate and super excited to start my journey into the tech industry to finally use the skills I have learnt these past 4 years. 
Through the course of my studies, I was able to expand my knowledge of tech and was even able to do 2 internships during my studies. I have 
ample experience working with game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine, web development tools such as React and Node, databases such as MongoDB and SQL, data analytics tools such as Python and Tableau and even artificial intelligence 
primarily in Python. I have an interest in many different areas of tech and would love to learn more, explore and grow with the ever-changing market. I am eagerly looking forward to using the skills I have garnered to create
software that could impact the world and make a difference."
